# Revision 154/155 
<sub>September 2, 2024</sub>

Dear community,

Canonical's newest Charmed MySQL Router K8s operator has been published in the [8.0/stable channel].

Due to the newly added support for arm64 architecture, the MySQL Router K8s charm now releases two revisions simultaneously:
* Revision 155 is built for `amd64` ( mysql-router-image r57 )
* Revision 154 is built for `arm64` ( mysql-router-image r57 )

To make sure you deploy for the right architecture, we recommend setting an [architecture constraint](https://juju.is/docs/juju/constraint#heading--arch) for your entire Juju model.

Otherwise, you can specify the architecture at deploy time with the `--constraints` flag as follows:

```shell
juju deploy mysql-router-k8s --constraints arch=<arch> --trust
```
where `<arch>` can be `amd64` or `arm64`.

## Technical details
This section contains some technical details about the charm's contents and dependencies. 

* The K8s NodePort used to expose the DB service will change after every refresh which might lead to disconnections of clients sitting outside Juju. Check more details in [DPE-5276](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/DPE-5276).

If you are jumping over several stable revisions, check [previous release notes][All releases] before upgrading.
