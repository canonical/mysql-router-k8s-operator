MySQL Router is part of InnoDB Cluster, and is lightweight middleware that provides transparent routing between your application and back-end MySQL Servers. It can be used for a wide variety of use cases, such as providing high availability and scalability by effectively routing database traffic to appropriate back-end MySQL Servers. The pluggable architecture also enables developers to extend MySQL Router for custom use cases.
